# Compute-Pi-with-Monte-Carlo-Methods
Computing π by using Monte Carlo Methods The Monte Carlo method uses a set of random points (x,y). If d is the distance from the origin, then nd is the number of points where d &lt;= 1. So π can be estimated by 4×(nd/nt), where nt is the total number of points.
